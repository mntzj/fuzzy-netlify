<p>A fun way to get familiar with working with APIs and handling JSON data with nested lists into tidy and nice rectangles of data.</p>
<p>In this post, we are going to try to <em>catch</em> some pokémons
using the API <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">pokeapi.co</a>.</p>
<p><em>note that in this example no authentication is required to access this API, and all resources are fully open and available</em> ..</p>
<div id="libs-and-links" class="section level1">
<h1>Libs and links</h1>
<p>We will need to load the packages </p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>httr</code>: for sending http requests. <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html">Docs for httr</a> </p></li>
<li><p><code>jsonlite</code> : handy when wrangling with json like data. <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html">Docs on jsonlite</a> </p></li>
<li><p><code>tidyverse</code> not necessary, base R does the job but I am quite fan of this framework. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>Check if you have them in your local library this way:
</p>
<p><img src="c1.png" /></p>
<p>And load
</p>
<p><img src="c2.png" /></p>
<p>Set the URL the api’s resource you are insterested in, Below I am looking just
for each pokemon (first 200 records) with the corresponding resource (URL). So each pokemons is an endpoint with multiple nested resources.</p>
<p><img src="c3.png" /></p>
<p>Raw json look like :</p>

<p><img src="Screenshot%202021-09-21%20at%2020.21.03.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section" class="section level1">
<h1></h1>
<p>Give it a try with <code>httr::GET</code> GET request</p>
<p><img src="c4.png" /></p>
<pre><code>## [1] 200</code></pre>
<p>Http status 200 OK ..</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgflip.com/21gr1.gif" /></p>
<p><img src="c5.png" /></p>
<p>Now we got these beautiful pokemons * _ * below</p>
